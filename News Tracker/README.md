# News Tracker

A desktop news application that fetches live breaking headlines
using the NewsAPI, with a floating marquee ticker, live feed,
and keyword search.

## How to Run

**GUI version (recommended):**
```
python news_tracker_gui.py
```

**Command line version:**
```
python news_tracker.py
```

**Or download the executable** from the
[Releases](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/python-projects/releases/tag/news-tracker-v1.0)
page — no Python installation required. Windows only.

## Setup

### Get a free API key
Sign up at [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) and copy your API key.
When you launch the app for the first time a settings popup will
appear asking for your key. It is saved locally to a .env file
and never shared or pushed to GitHub.
